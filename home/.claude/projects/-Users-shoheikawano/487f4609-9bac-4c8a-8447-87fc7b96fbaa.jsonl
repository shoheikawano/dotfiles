Only include details Claude doesn't already possess, as \"the context window is a public good.\"\n\n**Appropriate specificity**: Match guidance detail to task fragility—use text-based instructions for flexible approaches, pseudocode for preferred patterns, and specific scripts when \"operations are fragile and error-prone.\"\n\n## Skill Structure\n\nSkills require a `SKILL.md` file with:\n- **YAML frontmatter** containing `name` and `description` fields\n- **Markdown body** with implementation instructions\n\nOptional bundled resources include:\n- `scripts/` — Executable code for deterministic, reusable tasks\n- `references/` — Documentation loaded as needed during work\n- `assets/` — Templates and files used in outputs\n\n## Progressive Disclosure Pattern\n\nSkills use three loading levels to manage context efficiently:\n1. Metadata (always loaded)\n2. SKILL.md body (when triggered)\n3. Bundled resources (as needed)\n\nKeep SKILL.md under 500 lines and move detailed information to reference files, linking clearly from the main file.\n\n## Development Process\n\n1. Understand skill usage through concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable content (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize using `init_skill.py`\n4. Implement resources and write SKILL.md\n5. Package using `package_skill.py`\n6.

Only include details Claude doesn't already possess, as \"the context window is a public good.\"\n\n**Appropriate specificity**: Match guidance detail to task fragility—use text-based instructions for flexible approaches, pseudocode for preferred patterns, and specific scripts when \"operations are fragile and error-prone.\"\n\n## Skill Structure\n\nSkills require a `SKILL.md` file with:\n- **YAML frontmatter** containing `name` and `description` fields\n- **Markdown body** with implementation instructions\n\nOptional bundled resources include:\n- `scripts/` — Executable code for deterministic, reusable tasks\n- `references/` — Documentation loaded as needed during work\n- `assets/` — Templates and files used in outputs\n\n## Progressive Disclosure Pattern\n\nSkills use three loading levels to manage context efficiently:\n1. Metadata (always loaded)\n2. SKILL.md body (when triggered)\n3. Bundled resources (as needed)\n\nKeep SKILL.md under 500 lines and move detailed information to reference files, linking clearly from the main file.\n\n## Development Process\n\n1. Understand skill usage through concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable content (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize using `init_skill.py`\n4. Implement resources and write SKILL.md\n5.
