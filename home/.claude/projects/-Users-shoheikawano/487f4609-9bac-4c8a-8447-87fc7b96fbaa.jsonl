Only include details Claude doesn't already possess, as \"the context window is a public good.\"\n\n**Appropriate specificity**: Match guidance detail to task fragility—use text-based instructions for flexible approaches, pseudocode for preferred patterns, and specific scripts when \"operations are fragile and error-prone.\"\n\n## Skill Structure\n\nSkills require a `SKILL.md` file with:\n- **YAML frontmatter** containing `name` and `description` fields\n- **Markdown body** with implementation instructions\n\nOptional bundled resources include:\n- `scripts/` — Executable code for deterministic, reusable tasks\n- `references/` — Documentation loaded as needed during work\n- `assets/` — Templates and files used in outputs\n\n## Progressive Disclosure Pattern\n\nSkills use three loading levels to manage context efficiently:\n1. Metadata (always loaded)\n2. SKILL.md body (when triggered)\n3. Bundled resources (as needed)\n\nKeep SKILL.md under 500 lines and move detailed information to reference files, linking clearly from the main file.\n\n## Development Process\n\n1.

Only include details Claude doesn't already possess, as \"the context window is a public good.\"\n\n**Appropriate specificity**: Match guidance detail to task fragility—use text-based instructions for flexible approaches, pseudocode for preferred patterns, and specific scripts when \"operations are fragile and error-prone.\"\n\n## Skill Structure\n\nSkills require a `SKILL.md` file with:\n- **YAML frontmatter** containing `name` and `description` fields\n- **Markdown body** with implementation instructions\n\nOptional bundled resources include:\n- `scripts/` — Executable code for deterministic, reusable tasks\n- `references/` — Documentation loaded as needed during work\n- `assets/` — Templates and files used in outputs\n\n## Progressive Disclosure Pattern\n\nSkills use three loading levels to manage context efficiently:\n1. Metadata (always loaded)\n2. SKILL.md body (when triggered)\n3. Bundled resources (as needed)\n\nKeep SKILL.md under 500 lines and move detailed information to reference files, linking clearly from the main file.\n\n## Development Process\n\n1. Understand skill usage through concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable content (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize using `init_skill.py`\n4. Implement resources and write SKILL.md\n5.

Let me compile this into a well-structured response.\n\n## Comprehensive Claude Agent SDK Information for Agent Creator Skill\n\nBased on the official documentation, here's everything you need to create an agent-creator skill:\n\n---\n\n## 1. How to Create Custom Agents in Claude Code\n\nThere are **three ways to create agents** in Claude Code:\n\n### Option A: Programmatic Definition (Agent SDK)\nCreate agents directly in code using the `AgentDefinition` class:\n\n```python\nfrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, AgentDefinition\n\nasync def main():\n    async for message in query(\n        prompt=\"Review the authentication module for security issues\",\n        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(\n            allowed_tools=[\"Read\", \"Grep\", \"Glob\", \"Task\"],\n            agents={\n                \"code-reviewer\": AgentDefinition(\n                    description=\"Expert code review specialist...\",\n                    prompt=\"You are a code review specialist...\",\n                    tools=[\"Read\", \"Grep\", \"Glob\"],\n                    model=\"sonnet\"\n                )\n            }\n        )\n    ):\n        pass\n```\n\n### Option B: Filesystem-Based (Claude Code CLI)\nCreate agents as Markdown files in `.claude/agents/` directories (this is what you'll want to document for the skill).\n\n### Option C: CLI-Based Configuration\nDefine agents dynamically via the `--agents` CLI flag with JSON configuration.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Agent Structure and Required Files\n\n### File Location Hierarchy\n\n```\nAgent Location      | Scope                    | Priority\n--------------------|--------------------------|----------\n.claude/agents/     | Current project          | Highest\n~/.claude/agents/   | All projects             | Lower\nCLI --agents flag   | Single session           | Medium\n```\n\n### Directory Structure Pattern\n\nFor **filesystem-based agents** (recommended for your skill):\n\n```\nagent-name/\n├── AGENT.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter\n│   │   ├── name (required)\n│   │   ├── description (required)\n│   │   ├── tools (optional)\n│   │   ├── model (optional)\n│   │   ├── permissionMode (optional)\n│   │   └── skills (optional)\n│   └── Markdown instructions\n├── scripts/         (optional)\n│   └── *.py, *.sh\n├── references/      (optional)\n│   └── *.md\n└── assets/          (optional)\n    └── templates, files\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Agent Configuration Format and Metadata\n\n### AGENT.md File Format\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: code-reviewer\ndescription: Expert code review specialist. Use for quality, security, and maintainability reviews. Proactively review code after modifications.\ntools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash\nmodel: sonnet\npermissionMode: acceptEdits\nskills: code-analysis, security-review\n---\n\n# Code Reviewer Agent\n\nYou are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality and security.\n\n## When Invoked\n\n1. Run git diff to see recent changes\n2. Focus on modified files\n3. Begin review immediately\n\n## Review Checklist\n\n- Code is clear and readable\n- Functions and variables are well-named\n- No duplicated code\n- Proper error handling\n- No exposed secrets or API keys\n- Input validation implemented\n- Good test coverage\n- Performance considerations addressed\n```\n\n### YAML Frontmatter Fields\n\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\n|:------|:-----|:---------|:------------|\n| `name` | string | **Yes** | Lowercase identifier (hyphen-case) |\n| `description` | string | **Yes** | When to use this agent (primary trigger) |\n| `tools` | string | No | Comma-separated tool list. Omit to inherit all tools |\n| `model` | string | No | `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `'inherit'`. Defaults to `sonnet` |\n| `permissionMode` | string | No | `default`, `acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan`, `ignore` |\n| `skills` | string | No | Comma-separated skill names to auto-load |\n\n**Important**: Do NOT include other fields in frontmatter.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Best Practices for Agent Development\n\n### Description Writing (Critical!)\nThe description field is the **primary triggering mechanism**:\n\n- Include both what the agent does AND when to use it\n- Include all \"when to use\" information here—not in the body\n- The body is only loaded AFTER triggering\n- Be specific and action-oriented\n- Example: \"Expert code reviewer for quality, security, and maintainability reviews. Use proactively after code changes. Focus on: code quality, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, adherence to standards.\"\n\n### Agent Design Principles\n\n1. **Single Clear Responsibility** - Design agents with one specific purpose\n2. **Detailed System Prompts** - Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints\n3. **Limit Tool Access** - Only grant necessary tools (improves focus and security)\n4. **Version Control** - Commit project agents to git for team collaboration\n5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Keep agent descriptions concise (~100 words)\n\n### System Prompt Best Practices\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: security-reviewer\ndescription: Security vulnerability scanner. Use for security audits and code reviews.\n---\n\nYou are a security expert specializing in identifying vulnerabilities.\n\n**Key practices:**\n- Scan for common security vulnerabilities\n- Check for data exposure risks\n- Identify authentication/authorization issues\n- Verify input validation\n- Check for secret exposure\n\n**Output format:**\n1. Critical Issues (must fix immediately)\n2. High Priority (fix before deployment)\n3. Medium Priority (fix when possible)\n4. Low Priority (consider improving)\n\nAlways provide specific examples and remediation steps.\n```\n\n### Common Agent Patterns\n\n| Agent Type | Tools | Use Case |\n|:-----------|:------|----------|\n| Code Analyzer | Read, Glob, Grep | Static analysis, architecture review (read-only) |\n| Test Runner | Bash, Read, Grep | Test execution and failure analysis |\n| Code Reviewer | Read, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash | Quality reviews and small fixes |\n| Security Scanner | Read, Grep, Glob | Vulnerability detection (read-only) |\n| Full Developer | All tools | Complex code modifications and implementation |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Validation Requirements for Agents\n\nThe Agent SDK and Claude Code validate agents for:\n\n### Required Validations\n- **YAML frontmatter**: Correct format with required fields (`name`, `description`)\n- **Naming conventions**: Lowercase, hyphen-separated (e.g., `code-reviewer`)\n- **Description completeness**: Non-empty, informative descriptions\n- **Tool availability**: Valid tool names that exist in Claude Code\n- **File organization**: Proper directory structure with AGENT.md at root\n\n### Recommended Validations (per skill-creator pattern)\n- **No extraneous files**: Only include essential files (scripts, references, assets)\n- **No auxiliary documentation**: Don't create README.md or other docs files\n- **File permissions**: Scripts should be executable (chmod 755)\n- **Valid markdown**: Proper frontmatter and markdown syntax\n\n### Example Validation Script Pattern\n\nBased on your skill-creator, you'd want to validate:\n```python\n# Check name format (hyphen-case, lowercase)\n# Check description length and quality\n# Check tool names against valid set\n# Check file structure\n# Validate YAML frontmatter\n# Ensure no duplicate agent names\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. How Agents Are Packaged and Distributed\n\n### Plugin-Based Distribution (Recommended)\n\nAgents can be distributed as part of **Claude Code Plugins**:\n\n```\nmy-plugin/\n├── manifest.json\n├── agents/\n│   ├── code-reviewer.md\n│   ├── security-scanner.md\n│   └── test-runner.md\n├── skills/\n├── commands/\n└── mcp-servers/\n```\n\n**Plugin Manifest Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"code-review-suite\",\n  \"description\": \"Professional code review agents\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"agents/code-reviewer.md\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"agents/security-scanner.md\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Direct Distribution\n\nAgents can also be shared as individual `.md` files for users to place in:\n- `.claude/agents/` (project-level)\n- `~/.claude/agents/` (user-level)\n\n### Packaging Format\n\n- **Single agent**: Distribute as `agent-name.md` file\n- **Agent suite**: Package as plugin (`.zip` or git repo)\n- **With resources**: Include `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` directories\n\n---\n\n## 7. Examples of Agent Implementations\n\n### Example 1: Code Reviewer Agent\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: code-reviewer\ndescription: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.\ntools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash\nmodel: inherit\n---\n\n# Code Reviewer Agent\n\nYou are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality and security.\n\n## When Invoked\n\n1. Run `git diff` to see recent changes\n2. Focus on modified files\n3. Begin review immediately\n\n## Review Checklist\n\n- Code is clear and readable\n- Functions and variables are well-named\n- No duplicated code\n- Proper error handling\n- No exposed secrets or API keys\n- Input validation implemented\n- Good test coverage\n- Performance considerations addressed\n\n## Feedback Format\n\nOrganize feedback by priority:\n\n**Critical issues (must fix):**\n- Specific line references\n- Explanation of the issue\n- Recommended fix\n\n**Warnings (should fix):**\n- Similar structure to critical\n\n**Suggestions (consider improving):**\n- Enhancement ideas\n- Alternative patterns\n```\n\n### Example 2: Security Scanner Agent\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: security-scanner\ndescription: Security vulnerability detection specialist. Use proactively to scan code for security issues, data exposure, and compliance violations.\ntools: Read, Grep, Glob\nmodel: sonnet\n---\n\n# Security Scanner Agent\n\nYou are a security expert specializing in identifying vulnerabilities in code.\n\n## Scanning Process\n\n1. Scan for common vulnerability patterns\n2. Check authentication/authorization logic\n3. Identify data exposure risks\n4. Verify input validation\n5. Check for secret exposure\n\n## Vulnerability Categories\n\n- **Authentication/Authorization**: Login flows, permission checks\n- **Data Exposure**: Logging sensitive data, unencrypted storage\n- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection\n- **Secrets Management**: API keys, passwords in code\n- **Cryptography**: Weak algorithms, improper implementations\n- **OWASP Top 10**: Coverage of major web vulnerabilities\n```\n\n### Example 3: Test Runner Agent\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: test-runner\ndescription: Testing automation specialist. Use to run tests, analyze failures, and fix broken tests while preserving original intent.\ntools: Bash, Read, Edit, Grep, Glob\npermissionMode: acceptEdits\n---\n\n# Test Runner Agent\n\nYou are a test automation expert specializing in test execution and failure analysis.\n\n## Testing Workflow\n\n1. Discover test framework and configuration\n2. Run full test suite\n3. Capture and analyze failures\n4. Identify root causes\n5. Implement targeted fixes\n6. Verify fixes with re-run\n\n## Approach to Fixing Tests\n\n- Preserve original test intent\n- Fix underlying code, not the test\n- Only modify test if code fix is impossible\n- Maintain test coverage levels\n- Document any changes made\n```\n\n### Example 4: Data Scientist Agent\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: data-scientist\ndescription: Data analysis expert for SQL queries and BigQuery operations. Use proactively for data analysis tasks, metrics queries, and data insights.\ntools: Bash, Read, Write\nmodel: sonnet\n---\n\n# Data Scientist Agent\n\nYou are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.\n\n## Analysis Workflow\n\n1. Understand data analysis requirement\n2. Write efficient SQL queries\n3. Use BigQuery CLI tools (bq) when appropriate\n4. Analyze and summarize results\n5. Present findings clearly\n\n## Query Best Practices\n\n- Write optimized queries with proper filters\n- Use appropriate aggregations and joins\n- Include comments explaining complex logic\n- Format results for readability\n- Provide data-driven recommendations\n- Ensure queries are cost-effective\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Query explanation\n- Result summary\n- Key insights\n- Recommended next steps\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Insights for Your Agent-Creator Skill\n\n### Structure Similar to skill-creator\n\nYour agent-creator skill should follow the same pattern as your existing skill-creator:\n\n```\nagent-creator/\n├── SKILL.md (main skill documentation)\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── init_agent.py (creates new agent template)\n│   ├── package_agent.py (validates and packages agents)\n│   └── quick_validate.py (validates existing agents)\n├── references/\n│   ├── agent-patterns.md (common agent designs)\n│   ├── validation-checklist.md (what to validate)\n│   └── tool-reference.md (valid tools and their uses)\n└── assets/\n    └── agent-template.md (base agent template)\n```\n\n### Key Differences from Skills\n\n| Aspect | Skills | Agents |\n|:-------|:-------|:-------|\n| File name | `SKILL.md` | `AGENT.md` |\n| Purpose | Extend capabilities | Delegate focused tasks |\n| Context | Loaded into main context | Separate context window |\n| Scope | Multi-purpose knowledge | Single responsibility |\n| Frontmatter | `name`, `description` | `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `permissionMode`, `skills` |\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Pattern\n\nFollowing skill-creator's design:\n\n1. **Metadata** (~100 words) - Name & description for when to use\n2. **AGENT.md body** (<500 lines) - Core workflow and system prompt\n3. **Bundled resources** (unlimited) - Scripts, references, assets\n\n---\n\n## Documentation References\n\n- **Claude Code Subagents**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents.md\n- **Agent SDK Overview**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview.md\n- **Agent SDK Subagents**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents.md\n- **Agent SDK Quickstart**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/quickstart.md\n- **Plugins Reference**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md\n\n---\n\n## Actionable Next Steps for Creating Your Skill\n\n1. **Study existing agents** in Claude Code's built-in examples (code-reviewer, debugger, data-scientist)\n2. **Create init_agent.py** - template generator similar to init_skill.py\n3. **Create validate_agent.py** - validation script checking YAML, naming, tools\n4. **Write agent-patterns.md** - reference file with common agent designs\n5. **Build package_agent.py** - packager for agent distribution\n6. **Document tool-reference.md** - comprehensive tool availability list\n\nThis structure directly mirrors your skill-creator and provides the necessary scaffolding for users to create high-quality agents efficiently."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a2af292 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"uuid":"e71f43f0-58cc-49b8-a67d-b814bbac4c73","timestamp":"2026-01-02T18:27:16.337Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need comprehensive information about the Claude Agent SDK to create an agent-creator skill.

Focus on: code quality, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, adherence to standards.\"\n\n### Agent Design Principles\n\n1. **Single Clear Responsibility** - Design agents with one specific purpose\n2. **Detailed System Prompts** - Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints\n3. **Limit Tool Access** - Only grant necessary tools (improves focus and security)\n4. **Version Control** - Commit project agents to git for team collaboration\n5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Keep agent descriptions concise (~100 words)\n\n### System Prompt Best Practices\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: security-reviewer\ndescription: Security vulnerability scanner. Use for security audits and code reviews.\n---\n\nYou are a security expert specializing in identifying vulnerabilities.\n\n**Key practices:**\n- Scan for common security vulnerabilities\n- Check for data exposure risks\n- Identify authentication/authorization issues\n- Verify input validation\n- Check for secret exposure\n\n**Output format:**\n1. Critical Issues (must fix immediately)\n2. High Priority (fix before deployment)\n3. Medium Priority (fix when possible)\n4. Low Priority (consider improving)\n\nAlways provide specific examples and remediation steps.\n```\n\n### Common Agent Patterns\n\n| Agent Type | Tools | Use Case |\n|:-----------|:------|----------|\n| Code Analyzer | Read, Glob, Grep | Static analysis, architecture review (read-only) |\n| Test Runner | Bash, Read, Grep | Test execution and failure analysis |\n| Code Reviewer | Read, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash | Quality reviews and small fixes |\n| Security Scanner | Read, Grep, Glob | Vulnerability detection (read-only) |\n| Full Developer | All tools | Complex code modifications and implementation |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Validation Requirements for Agents\n\nThe Agent SDK and Claude Code validate agents for:\n\n### Required Validations\n- **YAML frontmatter**: Correct format with required fields (`name`, `description`)\n- **Naming conventions**: Lowercase, hyphen-separated (e.g., `code-reviewer`)\n- **Description completeness**: Non-empty, informative descriptions\n- **Tool availability**: Valid tool names that exist in Claude Code\n- **File organization**: Proper directory structure with AGENT.md at root\n\n### Recommended Validations (per skill-creator pattern)\n- **No extraneous files**: Only include essential files (scripts, references, assets)\n- **No auxiliary documentation**: Don't create README.md or other docs files\n- **File permissions**: Scripts should be executable (chmod 755)\n- **Valid markdown**: Proper frontmatter and markdown syntax\n\n### Example Validation Script Pattern\n\nBased on your skill-creator, you'd want to validate:\n```python\n# Check name format (hyphen-case, lowercase)\n# Check description length and quality\n# Check tool names against valid set\n# Check file structure\n# Validate YAML frontmatter\n# Ensure no duplicate agent names\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. How Agents Are Packaged and Distributed\n\n### Plugin-Based Distribution (Recommended)\n\nAgents can be distributed as part of **Claude Code Plugins**:\n\n```\nmy-plugin/\n├── manifest.json\n├── agents/\n│   ├── code-reviewer.md\n│   ├── security-scanner.md\n│   └── test-runner.md\n├── skills/\n├── commands/\n└── mcp-servers/\n```\n\n**Plugin Manifest Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"code-review-suite\",\n  \"description\": \"Professional code review agents\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"agents/code-reviewer.md\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"agents/security-scanner.md\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Direct Distribution\n\nAgents can also be shared as individual `.md` files for users to place in:\n- `.claude/agents/` (project-level)\n- `~/.claude/agents/` (user-level)\n\n### Packaging Format\n\n- **Single agent**: Distribute as `agent-name.md` file\n- **Agent suite**: Package as plugin (`.zip` or git repo)\n- **With resources**: Include `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` directories\n\n---\n\n## 7. Examples of Agent Implementations\n\n### Example 1: Code Reviewer Agent\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: code-reviewer\ndescription: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.\ntools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash\nmodel: inherit\n---\n\n# Code Reviewer Agent\n\nYou are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality and security.\n\n## When Invoked\n\n1. Run `git diff` to see recent changes\n2. Focus on modified files\n3. Begin review immediately\n\n## Review Checklist\n\n- Code is clear and readable\n- Functions and variables are well-named\n- No duplicated code\n- Proper error handling\n- No exposed secrets or API keys\n- Input validation implemented\n- Good test coverage\n- Performance considerations addressed\n\n## Feedback Format\n\nOrganize feedback by priority:\n\n**Critical issues (must fix):**\n- Specific line references\n- Explanation of the issue\n- Recommended fix\n\n**Warnings (should fix):**\n- Similar structure to critical\n\n**Suggestions (consider improving):**\n- Enhancement ideas\n- Alternative patterns\n```\n\n### Example 2: Security Scanner Agent\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: security-scanner\ndescription: Security vulnerability detection specialist. Use proactively to scan code for security issues, data exposure, and compliance violations.\ntools: Read, Grep, Glob\nmodel: sonnet\n---\n\n# Security Scanner Agent\n\nYou are a security expert specializing in identifying vulnerabilities in code.\n\n## Scanning Process\n\n1. Scan for common vulnerability patterns\n2. Check authentication/authorization logic\n3. Identify data exposure risks\n4. Verify input validation\n5. Check for secret exposure\n\n## Vulnerability Categories\n\n- **Authentication/Authorization**: Login flows, permission checks\n- **Data Exposure**: Logging sensitive data, unencrypted storage\n- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection\n- **Secrets Management**: API keys, passwords in code\n- **Cryptography**: Weak algorithms, improper implementations\n- **OWASP Top 10**: Coverage of major web vulnerabilities\n```\n\n### Example 3: Test Runner Agent\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: test-runner\ndescription: Testing automation specialist. Use to run tests, analyze failures, and fix broken tests while preserving original intent.\ntools: Bash, Read, Edit, Grep, Glob\npermissionMode: acceptEdits\n---\n\n# Test Runner Agent\n\nYou are a test automation expert specializing in test execution and failure analysis.\n\n## Testing Workflow\n\n1. Discover test framework and configuration\n2. Run full test suite\n3. Capture and analyze failures\n4. Identify root causes\n5. Implement targeted fixes\n6. Verify fixes with re-run\n\n## Approach to Fixing Tests\n\n- Preserve original test intent\n- Fix underlying code, not the test\n- Only modify test if code fix is impossible\n- Maintain test coverage levels\n- Document any changes made\n```\n\n### Example 4: Data Scientist Agent\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: data-scientist\ndescription: Data analysis expert for SQL queries and BigQuery operations. Use proactively for data analysis tasks, metrics queries, and data insights.\ntools: Bash, Read, Write\nmodel: sonnet\n---\n\n# Data Scientist Agent\n\nYou are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.\n\n## Analysis Workflow\n\n1. Understand data analysis requirement\n2. Write efficient SQL queries\n3. Use BigQuery CLI tools (bq) when appropriate\n4. Analyze and summarize results\n5. Present findings clearly\n\n## Query Best Practices\n\n- Write optimized queries with proper filters\n- Use appropriate aggregations and joins\n- Include comments explaining complex logic\n- Format results for readability\n- Provide data-driven recommendations\n- Ensure queries are cost-effective\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Query explanation\n- Result summary\n- Key insights\n- Recommended next steps\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Insights for Your Agent-Creator Skill\n\n### Structure Similar to skill-creator\n\nYour agent-creator skill should follow the same pattern as your existing skill-creator:\n\n```\nagent-creator/\n├── SKILL.md (main skill documentation)\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── init_agent.py (creates new agent template)\n│   ├── package_agent.py (validates and packages agents)\n│   └── quick_validate.py (validates existing agents)\n├── references/\n│   ├── agent-patterns.md (common agent designs)\n│   ├── validation-checklist.md (what to validate)\n│   └── tool-reference.md (valid tools and their uses)\n└── assets/\n    └── agent-template.md (base agent template)\n```\n\n### Key Differences from Skills\n\n| Aspect | Skills | Agents |\n|:-------|:-------|:-------|\n| File name | `SKILL.md` | `AGENT.md` |\n| Purpose | Extend capabilities | Delegate focused tasks |\n| Context | Loaded into main context | Separate context window |\n| Scope | Multi-purpose knowledge | Single responsibility |\n| Frontmatter | `name`, `description` | `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `permissionMode`, `skills` |\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Pattern\n\nFollowing skill-creator's design:\n\n1. **Metadata** (~100 words) - Name & description for when to use\n2. **AGENT.md body** (<500 lines) - Core workflow and system prompt\n3. **Bundled resources** (unlimited) - Scripts, references, assets\n\n---\n\n## Documentation References\n\n- **Claude Code Subagents**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents.md\n- **Agent SDK Overview**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview.md\n- **Agent SDK Subagents**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents.md\n- **Agent SDK Quickstart**: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/quickstart.md\n- **Plugins Reference**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md\n\n---\n\n## Actionable Next Steps for Creating Your Skill\n\n1. **Study existing agents** in Claude Code's built-in examples (code-reviewer, debugger, data-scientist)\n2. **Create init_agent.py** - template generator similar to init_skill.py\n3. **Create validate_agent.py** - validation script checking YAML, naming, tools\n4. **Write agent-patterns.md** - reference file with common agent designs\n5. **Build package_agent.py** - packager for agent distribution\n6. **Document tool-reference.md** - comprehensive tool availability list\n\nThis structure directly mirrors your skill-creator and provides the necessary scaffolding for users to create high-quality agents efficiently."}],"totalDurationMs":55192,"totalTokens":48491,"totalToolUseCount":11,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11350,"cache_read_input_tokens":33419,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11350,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3716,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

First action\n2. Second action\n3. Begin main workflow\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. Step one\n2. Step two\n3. Step three\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Format specification\n- Structure requirements\n- Presentation guidelines\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Key principle 1\n- Key principle 2\n- Key principle 3\n```\n\nReference: `references/agent-patterns.md` for common agent design patterns.\n\n## Implementation Process\n\n### Option A: Use Automated Initialization\n\n```bash\npython ~/.claude/skills/agent-creator/scripts/init_agent.py <agent-name> --path <path>\n```\n\nThis creates:\n- Agent directory structure\n- AGENT.md template with frontmatter\n- Example scripts, references, and assets directories\n\n**Default paths:**\n- `.claude/agents/` - Project-level (current project only)\n- `~/.claude/agents/` - User-level (all projects)\n\n### Option B: Manual Creation\n\n1. Create directory: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents/my-agent`\n2. Create AGENT.md with proper frontmatter\n3. Add optional resources (scripts/, references/, assets/)\n4.

Be specific and action-oriented.\ntools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash\nmodel: sonnet\npermissionMode: acceptEdits\nskills: skill-one, skill-two\n---\n```\n\n**Required fields:**\n- `name` - Lowercase, hyphen-case identifier\n- `description` - What and when (primary trigger)\n\n**Optional fields:**\n- `tools` - Comma-separated tool list (omit to inherit all)\n- `model` - `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit` (default: `sonnet`)\n- `permissionMode` - See step 3 above (default: `default`)\n- `skills` - Comma-separated skill names to auto-load\n\n## Validation\n\nBefore deploying your agent:\n\n```bash\npython ~/.claude/skills/agent-creator/scripts/validate_agent.py <agent-path>\n```\n\n**Validation checks:**\n- AGENT.md exists\n- Valid YAML frontmatter\n- Required fields present\n- Name follows hyphen-case convention\n- Tools are valid\n- File structure is clean\n\nReference: `references/validation-checklist.md` for complete validation requirements.\n\n## Testing Your Agent\n\n1. **Invoke directly:** Use the Task tool to test\n2. **Check triggering:** Verify description triggers appropriately\n3. **Validate output:** Ensure agent produces expected results\n4. **Iterate:** Refine based on real usage\n\n## Distribution\n\n### Project-Level (Recommended)\nPlace in `.claude/agents/` and commit to version control for team sharing.\n\n### User-Level\nPlace in `~/.claude/agents/` for personal use across all projects.\n\n### Plugin Distribution\nPackage agents as part of a Claude Code plugin with manifest.json.\n\n## Key Design Principles\n\n1. **Single Clear Responsibility** - One specific purpose per agent\n2. **Detailed System Prompts** - Include specific instructions and examples\n3. **Limit Tool Access** - Grant only necessary tools\n4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Keep descriptions concise (~100 words)\n5. **Version Control** - Commit project agents for team collaboration\n\n## Common Agent Patterns\n\nReference `references/agent-patterns.md` for detailed examples:\n\n- **Code Reviewer** - Quality and security reviews\n- **Security Scanner** - Vulnerability detection\n- **Test Runner** - Test execution and failure analysis\n- **Refactoring Specialist** - Code restructuring\n- **Documentation Writer** - Auto-documentation generation\n- **Performance Analyzer** - Performance profiling and optimization\n- **API Designer** - API endpoint design and implementation\n- **Database Expert** - SQL query optimization and design\n- **DevOps Engineer** - CI/CD and deployment automation\n\n## Resources\n\n- **scripts/init_agent.py** - Initialize new agent template\n- **scripts/validate_agent.py** - Validate agent structure\n- **references/agent-patterns.md** - Common agent designs\n- **references/tool-reference.md** - Available tools and usage\n- **references/validation-checklist.md** - Validation requirements\n- **assets/agent-template.md** - Base agent template\n\n## Quick Start Example\n\n```bash\n# 1. Initialize new agent\npython ~/.claude/skills/agent-creator/scripts/init_agent.py code-reviewer --path ~/.claude/agents\n\n# 2. Edit the generated AGENT.md\n\n# 3. Validate\npython ~/.claude/skills/agent-creator/scripts/validate_agent.py ~/.claude/agents/code-reviewer\n\n# 4. Test by invoking from main agent\n# Use Task tool with your new agent name\n```\n\n## Context Window Management\n\nRemember: The context window is a shared resource.\n\n- Keep AGENT.md under 500 lines\n- Move detailed documentation to `references/`\n- Use scripts for deterministic operations\n- Link clearly from main file to bundled resources\n\n## Best Practices Summary\n\n- **Description triggers everything** - Make it specific and actionable\n- **Single responsibility** - One clear purpose per agent\n- **Minimal tool access** - Only grant necessary tools\n- **Progressive disclosure** - Concise metadata, detailed resources\n- **Test with real tasks** - Iterate based on actual usage\n- **Version control** - Commit agents for team collaboration\n"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":388,"cache_read_input_tokens":41130,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":388,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2462,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWj2L2CscQLv7tzcecKLB","type":"assistant","uuid":"c213360b-96e0-459a-a409-db03e3fae441","timestamp":"2026-01-02T18:28:31.907Z"}

Validate\npython ~/.claude/skills/agent-creator/scripts/validate_agent.py ~/.claude/agents/code-reviewer\n\n# 4. Test by invoking from main agent\n# Use Task tool with your new agent name\n```\n\n## Context Window Management\n\nRemember: The context window is a shared resource.\n\n- Keep AGENT.md under 500 lines\n- Move detailed documentation to `references/`\n- Use scripts for deterministic operations\n- Link clearly from main file to bundled resources\n\n## Best Practices Summary\n\n- **Description triggers everything** - Make it specific and actionable\n- **Single responsibility** - One clear purpose per agent\n- **Minimal tool access** - Only grant necessary tools\n- **Progressive disclosure** - Concise metadata, detailed resources\n- **Test with real tasks** - Iterate based on actual usage\n- **Version control** - Commit agents for team collaboration\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

checks\n- User approves edits\n- Best for most agents\n\n### `acceptEdits`\n- Auto-accept file edits\n- User still sees changes\n- Good for trusted automation\n\n### `bypassPermissions`\n- Skip all permission checks\n- Use very sparingly\n- Only for fully automated workflows\n\n### `plan`\n- Always enter planning mode first\n- Good for complex changes\n- Requires user approval before execution\n\n### `ignore`\n- Don't show permission requests in UI\n- Background automation\n- Use for non-interactive agents\n\n---\n\n## Tool Selection Guide\n\nWhen choosing tools for your agent:\n\n1. **Start minimal** - Grant only absolutely necessary tools\n2. **Read before write** - Always include Read if you include Write/Edit\n3. **Search capabilities** - Include Grep and Glob for code navigation\n4. **Execution needs** - Only add Bash if shell commands required\n5. **Safety first** - Avoid Write/Edit for read-only analysis\n\n### Decision Tree\n\n```\nDoes agent modify files?\n├─ No  → Read, Grep, Glob\n└─ Yes\n   └─ Small targeted edits?\n      ├─ Yes → Read, Edit, Grep, Glob\n      └─ No\n         └─ Creates new files?\n            ├─ Yes → Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob\n            └─ No  → Read, Edit, Grep, Glob\n\nDoes agent need to run commands?\n├─ Yes → Add Bash\n└─ No  → Omit Bash\n\nDoes agent delegate tasks?\n├─ Yes → Add Task, possibly TaskOutput\n└─ No  → Omit Task\n\nDoes agent need planning?\n├─ Yes → Set permissionMode: plan (EnterPlanMode auto-available)\n└─ No  → Use default permission mode\n\nDoes agent need web access?\n├─ Yes → Add WebSearch and/or WebFetch\n└─ No  → Omit web tools\n```\n\n---\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### High-Risk Tools\n- **Bash** - Can execute arbitrary commands\n- **Write** - Can create files anywhere\n- **Edit** - Can modify critical files\n\n### Recommended Safeguards\n1. Use `permissionMode: default` unless strong reason not to\n2. Limit Bash to specific, known commands when possible\n3. Never bypass permissions for agents with Bash access\n4.

permission checks\n- Use very sparingly\n- Only for fully automated workflows\n\n### `plan`\n- Always enter planning mode first\n- Good for complex changes\n- Requires user approval before execution\n\n### `ignore`\n- Don't show permission requests in UI\n- Background automation\n- Use for non-interactive agents\n\n---\n\n## Tool Selection Guide\n\nWhen choosing tools for your agent:\n\n1. **Start minimal** - Grant only absolutely necessary tools\n2. **Read before write** - Always include Read if you include Write/Edit\n3. **Search capabilities** - Include Grep and Glob for code navigation\n4. **Execution needs** - Only add Bash if shell commands required\n5. **Safety first** - Avoid Write/Edit for read-only analysis\n\n### Decision Tree\n\n```\nDoes agent modify files?\n├─ No  → Read, Grep, Glob\n└─ Yes\n   └─ Small targeted edits?\n      ├─ Yes → Read, Edit, Grep, Glob\n      └─ No\n         └─ Creates new files?\n            ├─ Yes → Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob\n            └─ No  → Read, Edit, Grep, Glob\n\nDoes agent need to run commands?\n├─ Yes → Add Bash\n└─ No  → Omit Bash\n\nDoes agent delegate tasks?\n├─ Yes → Add Task, possibly TaskOutput\n└─ No  → Omit Task\n\nDoes agent need planning?\n├─ Yes → Set permissionMode: plan (EnterPlanMode auto-available)\n└─ No  → Use default permission mode\n\nDoes agent need web access?\n├─ Yes → Add WebSearch and/or WebFetch\n└─ No  → Omit web tools\n```\n\n---\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### High-Risk Tools\n- **Bash** - Can execute arbitrary commands\n- **Write** - Can create files anywhere\n- **Edit** - Can modify critical files\n\n### Recommended Safeguards\n1. Use `permissionMode: default` unless strong reason not to\n2. Limit Bash to specific, known commands when possible\n3. Never bypass permissions for agents with Bash access\n4. Test agents in safe environments first\n5. Review agent-generated code before deployment\n\n---\n\n## Tool Availability\n\nAll tools listed here are available in Claude Code.
